my main goal
1. show street level detailed maps - latest data
2. click on any point on map that will open a modal where you can mark it as danger location
3. in street map view, anyone can use filters to find nearby danger zones(already marked by other real users)
4. also to show users own location to fins out how far or near he/she is from the search result locations(displayed on map using markers or logos)
